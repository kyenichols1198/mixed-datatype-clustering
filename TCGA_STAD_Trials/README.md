# TCGA STAD Data Collection, Cleaning, And Model Implementation

Here are instructions for fetching the TCGA STAD data from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), 
the scripts we used for cleaning the data and engineering our dataset, and for the implementation of 
the mixed-datatype-clustering algorithm on the data.
